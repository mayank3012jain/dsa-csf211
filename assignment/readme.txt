The code implements linked list without the use of pointers in an array.
It tries to simulate an actual memory space like that. The free memory is stored in a stack made from a linked list called freeList.
The defrag function is used to defragment the array.

To run the code:
download the repo and type make in terminal in the assignment folder.
